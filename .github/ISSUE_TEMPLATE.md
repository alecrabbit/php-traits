Hello,

I encountered an issue with the following code:
```php
// code
```
Library version: **PUT HERE YOUR COMPOSER LIBRARY VERSION**
<!--
Run the command `composer show alecrabbit/php-helpers`
to get "versions".
-->

PHP version: **PUT HERE YOUR PHP VERSION**
<!--
Run the command `php -v` or
Use `echo phpversion();`
to get PHP version.
-->

I expected to get:
```
6
```
<!--
Always give your expectations. Each use has their owns.
-->

But I actually get:
```
5
```
Thanks!
